# api.sms.et

This is the ReST api for the sms application currently being developed using django and django rest framework.

> Important: To run it locally use the **8055** port (Why? b/c when you convert ```sms``` to leet speak you get ```5M5``` and since ports only use numbers I chose to stick to the ```55```)
