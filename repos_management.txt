the way our repos are setup are:

api.sms.et uses the 1st repo created, i.e. github.com/api.sms.et. All edits,
modifications and updates will be pushed to that repo. Once you decide that
all is well you will merge those updates with local/master then push that
origin/master.

the local/master will also be merged with local/production and that will be
push to the 2nd repo's local_jug branch, i.e.
github.com/api.sms.et_production. Once you decide all is dandy with this
branch you'll merge it, on remote, with the master branch of
github.com/api.sms.et_production.

You'll then proceed to merge that with remote_jug and pull remote_jug to the
server git, if all is well on server and it works as expected or if you've
made any modifications, you'll push that to origin/remote_jug. If all is dandy with this push you'll merge, again on remote, with origin/master which you'll then proceed to merge to local_jug and pull that to the production branch of api.sms.et.

use "git push origin HEAD:remote_jug"
